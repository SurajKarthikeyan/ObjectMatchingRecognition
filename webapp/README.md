To open the website:

1) Open the file "start.py" and run it. It should display the following:

"""


WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000


"""

2) Click on the link (http://127.0.0.1:5000) or open a new tab and put that link in the address bar.
Now the website is open and you can begin working with photos

3)  Click 'Choose File' and select an image from your directory, then hit "Upload File"
This will bring you to http://127.0.0.1:5000/upload, and your image should be displayed
